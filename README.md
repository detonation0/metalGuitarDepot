================

Website build in my CIS425 class using .php. The project was to build an e-commerce site and since I play the guitar, the site was for selling guitar and guitar accessories. It was never finished, only had a few months to work on it during the end of the semester. But the user login/logout functionality works and the database populates with products and displays them correctly. The cart system was never finished sadly.
